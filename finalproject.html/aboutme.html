		<h2>All About Me</h2>


<main>
		<p> My name is Reggie Davis I'm grew up on the south side of Chicago where i went to a charter school from 1st to 8th grade and I went to Martin Luther King College Prep for highschool. During these times I took on the love for music. everything I did involved music. When I played sports I had my music with me to keep me pumped and ready to play and I was even in band playing the snare making different beats. I then started to take on this idea of becoming a future producer. So i enrolled into Mizzou where I started college and I didn't really like the curriculum so I decided to come here and take on my producer journey here. I will finish my producer journey here but my love for music just allows me to wanna produce music even more and in many different ways. </p>
